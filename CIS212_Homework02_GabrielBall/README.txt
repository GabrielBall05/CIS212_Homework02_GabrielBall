How the program works: The site starts off with 3 dummy posts to give the user an idea of what a post looks
   like. At the top of the screen, there is a header with 2 buttons: Main Page and New Post. Clicking
   New Post will take you to a page to make a new post. You then can fill in your post's title, type (category),
   and start typing your blog post. Clicking the Post button just below will add that post to the list of posts.
   It will then take you back to the main page where you can see it. The date is autogenerated. Clicking any post
   allows you to view the details of that post. You can also delete the post from there by clicking the Delete
   button. Clicking Delete will give you a popup asking if you are sure you want to delete it. If you click OK,
   the post will be deleted and you will be taken back to the main page to see that it is gone. If you click cancel,
   nothing will happen. The Main Page button at the top will take you back to the main page.

Issues I ran into: Viewing details and finding the correct function to delete an element from an array. I solved the
   details issue by putting the index of the post you click into session storage. I was able to find the function that
   can delete an element from an array by researching for a little bit.
